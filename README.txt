Instructions to Run P2P-CI:

Install Python 3.11

Open server.py and client.py (Both clients can be opened from their folders). Make sure the client programs stay in their folders as they only have knowledge about the text files within their folders.

If you are running this on multiple machines then you can use the IP address for the server.
Otherwise, when opening clients make sure to type in 127.0.0.1 for the server.

RFC Files: The RFC Files are listed by the clients on their startup.

Commands: All valid commands are listed out by the clients
